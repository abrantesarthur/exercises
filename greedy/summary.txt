common characteristics of dynamic programming problems:
    we have to make a decision
        rod cutting problem: where to cut the rod next or whether to make a cut at a specific place or not
        Longgest Common Subsequence: eliminate last element from X or from Y
        matrix multiplicatoin: where to split the set
        grid traveler: whether to go down or right
        canSum: which number to subtract next
    each decision usually increases the problem space
        rod-cutting: cutting a rod transforms it into two smaller rods
        longest common subsequence: eliminating from X or from Y yields two combinations of inputs (one in which X is smaller and another in which Y is smaller)
        matrix multiplicatoin: splitting the set yields two sets
        grid traveler: two options of grid from choosing to go down or right
        canSum: each choice of number to subtract from the sum yields a new sum 
    each decision diminishes each problem size in some sense
        rod-cutting: the size of the rod diminishes
        Longest Common Subsequence: size of input sequences diminishes
        matrix multiplicatoin: size of sets diminishes
        grid-traveler: size of grid diminishes
        canSum: total sum diminishes
    the solution to the problem is a combination to solution to subproblems
        rod-cutting: it's the max between the value of not cutting and the sum of the values of each cut
        longest common-subsequence: the max of the results 
        matrix-multiplication: the minimum between the results 
        grid-traveler: the sum of the results
        canSum: the OR of the possibilities
how to solve a dynamic programming problem:
    decision
        which item to pick from the list
        whether to pick this one item or not
        which action to take
    how to combine so
    lutions: sum, max, min, or
